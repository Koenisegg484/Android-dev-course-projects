        The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain,
        is a country in Northwestern Europe, off the coast of the continental mainland.It comprises England, Scotland, Wales,
        and Northern Ireland. \n\t\tThe UK includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and
        most of the smaller islands within the British Isles. Northern Ireland shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland;
        otherwise, the United Kingdom is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel, the Celtic Sea, and the Irish Sea.
        The total area of the United Kingdom is 94,354 square miles (244,376 km2),12] with an estimated population of nearly 67.6 million people in 2022.
        \n\t\tIn 1707, the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland united under the Treaty of Union to create the Kingdom
        of Great Britain. The Acts of Union 1800 incorporated the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in
        1801. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922 as the Irish Free State, and the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 created the present
        name, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
